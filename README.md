  ## Description
  This application uses Node to connect to and display data from a mysql database. In doing so, I've utilized the following technologies:
  - JavaScript
  - Node.js (with inquirer and console.table packages)
  - MySQL

  ## Installation
  Use the command 'git clone' in your command line with the link of this repo while navigated to your desired directory to copy this repo to your machine, run 'npm install' or 'npm i' in your command line in the root folder of this application to install dependencies required (mysql2, inquirer, console.table). (note: it is not recommended to update the version of these dependencies, in order to ensure maximum compatability)

  ## Usage
  1. To use your own mysql database with this program, edit the connection.js file to include your credentials. Alternatively, you can install the dotenv node package and create a .env file to store and protect your credentials. 
  2. In your command line while in the root folder of the application, login to the mysql shell using the command 'mysql -u root -p'. If you are using a different mysql user specify that in place of root. You'll insert your password after executing this command.
  3. Run the following commands to start with a fresh database:
    * 'SOURCE db/db.sql'
    * 'SOURCE db/schema.sql'
    * To start with seed data, run 'SOURCE db/seeds.sql'
  4. Exit the mysql shell using 'quit;' 
  5. While still in the application root folder, run the command 'npm start' to initiate the application.
  6. Follow the prompts on the screen to view and alter the employee database information as you'd like!
